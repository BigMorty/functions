Solar elevation and azimuth over the course of November 2023. The black lines are lines of constant solar elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon, in degrees). The background color fills indicate the azimuth (the compass bearing) of the sun. The lightly tinted areas at the boundaries of the cardinal compass points indicate the implied intermediate directions (northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest).
Moon
The figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for November 2023. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.

Humidity
We base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.

The chance that a given day will be muggy in Seattle is essentially constant during November, remaining around 0% throughout.

For reference, on July 8, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.

Wind
This section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.

The average hourly wind speed in Seattle is gradually increasing during November, increasing from 4.7 miles per hour to 5.3 miles per hour over the course of the month.

For reference, on November 30, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 5.3 miles per hour, while on August 2, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 2.8 miles per hour.

Growing Season
Definitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).

The growing season in Seattle typically lasts for 9.0 months (272 days), from around February 24 to around November 23, rarely starting before January 17 or after March 19, and rarely ending before November 1 or after December 17.

During November in Seattle, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is very rapidly decreasing falling from 90% to 36% over the course of the month.

The percentage of time spent in various temperature bands. The black line is the percentage chance that a given day is within the growing season.
Growing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50°F and a cap of 86°F.

The average accumulated growing degree days in Seattle are essentially constant during November, remaining within 16°F of 2,261°F throughout.

Solar Energy
This section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.

The average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Seattle is gradually decreasing during November, falling by 0.8 kWh, from 1.8 kWh to 1.0 kWh, over the course of the month.

Topography
For the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Seattle are 47.606 deg latitude, -122.332 deg longitude, and 174 ft elevation.

The topography within 2 miles of Seattle contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 449 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 135 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (1,171 feet). Within 50 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (7,720 feet).

The area within 2 miles of Seattle is covered by artificial surfaces (69%) and water (31%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (47%) and water (40%), and within 50 miles by trees (52%) and water (14%).

Data Sources
This report illustrates the typical weather in Seattle, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.

Temperature and Dew Point
There are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Seattle.

For each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Seattle according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis  between the two locations.

The estimated value at Seattle is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Seattle and a given station.

The stations contributing to this reconstruction are:

King County International Airport (KBFI, 78%, 5 mi, south, -157 ft elevation change)
Snohomish County Airport (Paine Field) (KPAE, 11%, 21 mi, north, 430 ft elevation change)
Bremerton National Airport (KPWT, 11%, 22 mi, southwest, 269 ft elevation change)

To get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Seattle and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.

Other Data
All data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.

All other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.

Land Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

Elevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Names, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .

Time zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .

Disclaimer
The information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.

We draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.

We further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.
